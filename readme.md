# Aura Dogs

Aura Dogs is a project that combines Art + Technology to establish the first Animal Lovers crypto-native brand that engages in Animal Aid action alongside its community via the financial and commercial toolkit of Web3.

We're building an NFT Marketplace with a burn2redeem functionality for Polygon's Buidl It Hackathon!

## Animal Care and Aid 🐕

We will help to fund animal shelter organizations and adoption centers for stray dogs, as well as providing a platform for animal rights advocates.

We are a decentralized altruistic community connecting people to Web3 in a common mission to deliver investment and funding towards animal rights initiatives.

## Marketplace 🏪

Our marketplace will sell retail products with the Aura Dogs brand. Whereas it is in the metaverse or in an actual store, these products will help fund Animal Shelters.

The marketplace is available because of our own smart contract and it's integrated with OpenSea!
